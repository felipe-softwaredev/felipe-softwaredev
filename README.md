### Oi! 

"Oi! I'm Felipe, a Fullstack Developer driven by a passion for creating impactful solutions. My journey began in Brazil, where I practiced law, honing my skills to navigate the legal terrain. In 2019, I made the bold move to New York City, a bustling hub where I found inspiration and encouragement from remarkable professionals. It was here that I decided to pursue my long-held dream of a career in software development.

In 2022, I seized the opportunity, dedicating myself to self-study and graduating from Springboard's coding bootcamp. My background in law and experience in the corporate environment instill in me a unique perspective, bringing diverse ideas to the table.

As a self-starter and avid learner, I thrive on embracing new challenges and technologies. Collaboration is central to my approach; I firmly believe in the power of teamwork to bring ideas to fruition. Being a proud Latino and immigrant, I'm always eager to embrace fresh challenges and continue my learning journey.

Now firmly rooted in New York City, I'm excited to embark on this software development journey and see where it leads me!

Let's connect! I'm keen to explore opportunities for collaboration and bring your ideas to life."
